# 3D CAD Modeling Course

## Introduction

- Implemented 6 Euler operations and their corresponding inverse operations respectively, based on halfedge data structure;
- Implemented Sweep operation based on Euler Operations and generated solids rendered by OpenGL; 

## Configuration
  
- Environment: Windows VS2019
- Required third-party library:freeglut jsoncpp

## Usage

Run `CADWork.exe` and input a parameter as prompted
